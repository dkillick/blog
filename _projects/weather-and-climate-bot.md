## Project description
Working at the Microsoft offices in Reading, a small team of us from the lab have been exploring how to expose the national climate archive data via a chatbot ui.
This bot now allows users to ask searching questions in natural language about the weather and climate in the UK.
We have been using the JADE platform as the back end to support real-time distributed big-data queries against the archive.
