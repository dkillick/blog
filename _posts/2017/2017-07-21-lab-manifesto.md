Over the last couple of years we have built up our own culture in the Lab. Recently we have been talking about a set of principals that would help newcomers and outsiders get up to speed quickly. They are not exhaustive and we can't take credit for inventing all of them. However, we feel they encapsulate how to strive to work as a team.

## 1. Ask forgiveness not permission

If it's not obvious how to go about doing something in an 'official' or 'correct' manner go ahead and do it anyway. If it was the wrong thing to do, people will understand (provided you adhere to principles 1. and 2.), and you (and perhaps they) will have learnt something in the process. This attitude precipitates action and progress.

## 2. To live a creative life, we must lose our fear of being wrong

When you are creating something new, mistakes are more than inevitable, they are integral. We do not learn without making mistakes, successes only come after a series of failures. The Lab fosters a culture where it is safe to be wrong. We need to listen to opposing viewpoints with an open mind, offer our ideas and opinions readily, and encourage others to do the same. Repeatedly making the same mistake is, however, to be avoided where at all possible.

## 3. If there is no project card it shouldn't happen

For each project, we create a high level project card describing it (currently using Trello). If you find yourself doing some work without an associated card, then you probably shouldn't be doing it. These cards cover: why we are doing a project, a brief imagined future press release, concrete goals or questions to answer, the stakeholders, and what research themes they belong to. Crucially, these cards are private to encourage brutally honest, and therefore accurate, project definitions. This approach allows for clarity of purpose which avoids [yack shaving](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/yak_shaving). It also coordinates the group to acts as a whole.

## 4. If there is no blog post it didn't happen

Our work can produce a variety of useful outcomes: for instance a working prototype, a peer-reviewed research paper, or sometimes just an informed opinion. We record the useful things we do primarily as blog posts on our website. This has a few benefits. It is a historical record so we can point to what we've done. It obviously also allows us to share our thoughts with the world. Finally, verbalising the reason that what we have done matters helps us to conclude our work, and is the natural endpoint for principle 5.

## 5. No bean bags

"Innovation" has, in some places, become a dirty word. It conjurers up images of ping-pong tables and bean bag filled spaces that people use merely to talk endlessly about what they are going to do. This is bad innovation culture. Incidentally, we like bean-bags and ping-pong as much as the next person, but good intentions alone are not enough for productive innovation. Which brings us to...

## 6. Make things

Simply talking about things isn't enough. Ideas are cheap. Good innovation is built upon foundations of hard graft. As soon as possible you should make a proof of concept, prototype, minimum viable product - whatever you want to call it. Seeing is believing.

## 7. Premature optimization is the root of all evil

This old computer adage applies to more than just code. You can spend hours talking about how to do something, but there is only so much useful theorising you can do without the insight gained from getting your hands dirty. When building something the first thing you should do is make it work, even if it doesn't satisfy all of the requirements. You should create something simple and then iterate on it to make it better, but always leaving it in a working and usable state.

## 8. A long don't take the piss, just do it

This is the primary rule of the lab. It's fundamental for empowering Lab members to act, and therefore make progress. Ever feel like you should ask permission to do something? Just simply ask yourself if you think it takes the piss, if it doesn't then just do it and stop wasting time! In addition, as you are closer to the issue, you (not your boss) are often best placed to make this call.

## 9. See rule 8

Rule 8 is so foundational that it bears repeating. It also has a secondary function. The Lab is a hard-working close-knit team - you can't get a free ride, and there is nowhere to hide. We'll do all we can to help you perform, but if aren't self-motivated to with us, then perhaps this isn't the place for your.
