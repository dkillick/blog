Over the last couple of years we have built up our own culture in the lab. Recently we have been talking about a set of principals that would help newcomers and outsiders get up to speed with our culture quickly.

## 1. Don't take the piss

This is the primary rule of the lab. It is also a powerful rule in encouraging autonomy in members of the Lab. Ever feel like you should ask permission to do something? Just simply ask yourself if you think it takes the piss, if it doesn't then just do it and stop wasting time!

## 2. See rule 1

Rule 1 is a pretty important rule. It removes bottlenecks and waiting on higher ups to approve something. You only need to ask if you worry that it might take the piss, otherwise you can just get on with stuff.

## 3. Ask forgiveness not permission

Taken from the [Python Glossary](https://docs.python.org/2/glossary.html) term [EAFP](https://docs.python.org/2/glossary.html#term-eafp). This is another principal which empowers autonomous thinking. If it's not obvious who you should ask to do something then it's best to go ahead and do it provided it doesn't break rule 1. If it turns out that it was the wrong thing to do then you should ask for forgiveness, but this is often a rare occurrence.

## 4. If there is no Trello card it isn't happening

We plan our upcoming work using Trello. For each project the lab is working on we create a high level Trello card describing it. If you find yourself doing some work and there isn't an associated Trello card then you probably shouldn't be doing it.

## 5. If there is no blog post it didn't happen

We record our progress using blog posts on our website. As we have no requirement to create products or release software we need a way to mark milestones and demonstrate that we are actually doing useful things. Having blog posts to refer back to allows us to take credit for informing a piece of work when others implement operational projects based on innovations we've had.
