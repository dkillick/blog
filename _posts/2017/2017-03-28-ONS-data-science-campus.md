> The ONS Data Science Campus has been created to respond to this challenge and will act as a hub for the whole of the UK public and private sectors to gain practical advantage from the increased investment in data science research and capability building.
>
> The goal of the Campus will be to build a new generation of tools and technologies to exploit the growth and availability of innovative data sources and to provide rich informed measurement and analyses on the economy, the global environment and wider society.

It was a great opportunity to meet with data scientists from across government and industry. We look forward to collaborating with the new campus in the future!
