I am a physical geography graduate from the University of Edinburgh, fascinated by all things spatial. I joined the Informatics Lab in June 2017 for a summer placement, lured in by the opportunity to work with cutting edge tech and science. As one of my main interests is to find ways to apply new technologies to solve environmental problems, there could not be a better place to be!

I love beautiful data visualisations, so like a true geographer, I have a bit of an obsession with maps. In the future I want to pursue further studies in geoinformatics.

Before I joined the lab, I worked in schools as a science communicator and computer club tutor, helping to build a new generation of tech and science geeks.
