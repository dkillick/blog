I came to the Informatics Lab in June 2017 through the Met Office Summer Placements scheme. When I'm not at the Met Office, I live life as an undergraduate Physics student at the University of Manchester. I'll be going into my fourth and final year in September 2017.

I was drawn to the Lab because it lies at the intersection of two areas I am interested in: technology and Environmental Science.
