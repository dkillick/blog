Hello! I'm Tom.

For me the Informatics Lab presents an exciting opportunity to work closer with the Met Office's world-leading Scientists. I am really hoping to gain an insight into some of the clever stuff they do and help add some magical, cutting-edge technology fairy dust to better convey what's really going on.

Prior to joining the Lab I have been primarily working in middleware with Java in the Met Office's Data Services team. I have a real appetite to learn and as such have dabbled in various front and back-end technologies too, something I'm really looking forward to expanding upon whilst working in the Lab.

Outside of work, my main passion is sports, especially rugby! I play for my local team and enjoy the social side of rugby as much as the playing side. I have some really exciting things going on this year; I have just got married, in August, to my long-term girlfriend Nikki. We are currently working on extending our house, and we have just become the proud owners of a new Labrador puppy 'Harry' (in the picture).
