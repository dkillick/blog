I joined the Met Office in 2012 as an IT Trainee. In that role I dabbled in every part of Technology at the Met Office - from system administration through to QA and software development. After two years I joined the GeoApps team where I wrote geospatial web services using Python and Java.

In 2016 I joined the Informatics Lab, and I'm looking forward to helping build the next generation of scientific big data platforms.
